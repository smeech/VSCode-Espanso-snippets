# VSCode/VSCodium snippets
A collection of simple snippets in a JSON file for autocompletions in [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) YAML files

### Installation
Copy the `espanso.code-snippets` file into either:
1. your global `~/.config/VSCodium/User/snippets/` directory or VSCode equivalent, or
2. the root of your Espanso Project folder (e.g. `.config/espanso/.vscode/`) `.vscode` folder. 

> NB. You could paste the contents into a `yaml.json` in the snippets folder, but you'll need to remove the `"scope": "yaml",` entries.
